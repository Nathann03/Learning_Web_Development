    decide to change them to another color, you have to change them one by one -->

    <!-- <Style> ELEMENT BAD! -->
    <!-- Note: See how the <style> head tag is a much better improvement than inline
    styles. It takes a lot less time and effort to make every h2 pale violet red, but
    since there are multiple pages for every website, I would have to copy this <style>
    on every page-->
    <h2>I am an h2 #1</h2>
    <h2>I am an h2 #2</h2>
    <h2>I am an h2 #3</h2>

    <!-- Note: Using a style sheet is very easy and can be used for multiple .html for
    each page of a website -->
    <h3>I am using a style sheet</h3>
    <h3>Me Too!</h3>
